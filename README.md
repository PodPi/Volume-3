# Volume-3
PodPi Volume 3 is a fun way to learn!  From basic dot placement to full matrix animation.  let's get started...

### Paint dot by dot
`matrix.js`: Learn how to turn on and off specific dots on your 8x8 matrix.

### Display a custom character
`heart.js`: Make any custom character you want using the matrix and display them all at once. In this lesson you will learn how to create a matrix (see PodPi Volume 1 about arrays), and send it to the matrix.

### Stop-Motion
`stop.js`: Make a simple stop motion animation using a button to control each frame.

### Animate
`anim.js`: Make a full animation that you can control with a potentiometer. Make a matrix enabled flip-book.
